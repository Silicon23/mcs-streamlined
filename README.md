<img src='./images/MoreChineseStructures.jpg'>

MoreChineseStructures is a Minecraft datapack that enriches your gameplay experience by introducing a variety of traditional Chinese structures complete with unique gameplay elements to the world of Minecraft.

**This is a streamlined version of [the original datapack](https://github.com/Silicon23/MoreChineseStructures).** Some features are removed for compatibility purposes.

## Structures
### 4 New Villages
- Hui-Style Chinese Villages
- Yaodong Villages, a particular form of earth shelter dwelling common in the Loess Plateau in China's north.
- Ganlan Villages of the south
- Yurt Villages from Mongolia

### 4 Big structures to explore and conquer
- The tower
- The castle
- The skypalace
- Budda statues inspired by the Leshan Giant Buddha

### Other things
- various different temples scattered around the world
- Zheng He style fleet ships across the oceans.

## Biomes
Custom biomes and custom terrain generation is added in the [full version](https://github.com/Silicon23/MoreChineseStructures) of the datapack. This version does not add custom terrain generation, and so is compatible with other terrain modification plugins.
